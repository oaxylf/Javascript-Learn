  <h1>JavaScript-Learn - Ongoing</h1>
  <p>This repository is just how I learn javascript for approximately 3,5-5 weeks. Nothing else!</p>
</div>

<br />

## Prerequisites

Javascript is one of the language among others to use interpreter (scripting language). It means that we can write our code and then transfer it through the machine. Line per line will be executed by the machine. If the machine indicated an error though the written code, the error would be display during the **_runtime_** (ongoing process).

## Setup

Before I am going to code the language, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and select the desired operation system and architecture then follow the instruction for the installation.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can use **Web Browser** by using the shortcut of ` CTRL + Shift + I `, ` F12 ` or ` Left click > Inspect ` then go _Console_ and start writing up!

```javascript
// Copy this code and paste it on the console
console.log('Hello World');
```
## Clone
In order to get all of the codes, you can clone this repository using the following command:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/oaxylf/JavaScript-Learn
```

# Learning Path
## Basic Knowledge
### 1. The Difference Between Scripting and Compiled Language
<p>Have you ever heard the difference between both Scripting and Compiled Language?</p>

> Scripting Language used _interpreter_ to translate our written source code that can be run on our computer qithout using compiler.<br/>
> Compiled Language used _compiler_ to compile our written in order to run by computer into machine language and then it can be executed.

### 2. Runtime Environment
A runtime environment is the place where a program can be executed. Each runtime environment has its own unique objects that are only available within that environment. For example, **JavaScript** can be run in either a browser or Node.js. Both runtime environments have their own global object. Node.js cannot do what the browser can do, and the browser cannot do what Node.js can do.

> - In Node.js, the global object is called ` global `. Node.js does not automatically expose variables to the global scope unless they are explicitly attached to global.
> - In the browser, the global object is called ` window `.
